# Frontend Interface Design

This document showcases the user interface design for the Blockchain Voting System with ZK privacy and gasless transactions. The interface has been designed to provide a familiar web experience while leveraging blockchain technology behind the scenes.

## Landing Page

The landing page provides an overview of the voting system and directs users to the appropriate sections based on their role.

Key features:
- Clear navigation to voter and admin sections
- System overview and benefits

## Voter Experience

### Pre-Voting Authentication

Before voters can access the ballot, they must authenticate. In the blockchain version, this will be replaced with wallet connection:

Current implementation uses voter codes for authentication. In the blockchain version:
- Voters will connect their wallets instead of entering codes
- ZK proofs will verify eligibility without revealing identity
- Gasless transactions will eliminate blockchain complexity

### Candidate Selection

Once authenticated, voters can view and select candidates for each position:
